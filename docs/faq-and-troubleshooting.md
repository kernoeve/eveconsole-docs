# FAQ & Troubleshooting

## Where is my data stored?

Locally, in a SQLite database at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EveConsole\EveConsole.db`. Nothing
is uploaded; the app only talks to CCP's ESI API to refresh your data.

## Do I have to use the AI agent?

No. It's optional and stays inactive until you configure it. See
[AI Agent (Eden)](ai-agent-eden.md).

## Prices / build costs look wrong or empty

Make sure you've [configured a market](configuring-markets.md) and, for build costs,
an [industry park](industry-parks.md). Prices and build costs are (re)calculated as
market data refreshes while the app is running, so give it a refresh cycle after
first setup.

## Is this affiliated with CCP?

No. EVE Console is a third-party tool and is not affiliated with or endorsed by
CCP Games. EVE Online and the EVE logo are trademarks of CCP hf.
